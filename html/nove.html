            <h2>Letras:</h2>
            <p>You don't know, babe <br>
            When you hold me <br>
            And kiss me slowly <br>
            It's the sweetest thing <br>
            And it don't change <br>
            If I had it my way <br>
            You would know that you are <br>
            You're the coffee that I need in the morning <br>
            You're my sunshine in the rain when it's pouring <br>
            Won't you give yourself to me <br>
            Give it all, oh <br>
            I just wanna see <br>
            I just wanna see how beautiful you are <br>
            You know that I see it <br>
            I know you're a star <br>
            Where you go I follow <br>
            No matter how far <br>
            If life is a movie <br>
            Oh you're the best part, oh oh oh <br>
            You're the best part, oh oh oh <br>
            Best part <br>
            It's the sunrise <br>
            And those brown eyes, yes <br>
            You're the one that I desire <br>
            When we wake up <br>
            And then we make love <br>
            It makes me feel so nice <br>
            You're my water when I'm stuck in the desert <br>
            You're the Tylenol I take when my head hurts <br>
            You're the sunshine on my life <br>
            I just wanna see how beautiful you are <br>
            You know that I see it <br>
            I know you're a star <br>
            Where you go I follow <br>
            No matter how far <br>
            If life is a movie <br>
            Then you're the  <br>best part, oh oh oh <br>
            You're the best part, oh oh oh <br>
            Best part <br>
            If you love me won't you say something <br>
            If you love me won't you <br>
            Won't you <br>
            If you love me won't you say something <br>
            If you love me won't you <br>

            <p>How can I tell if <br> 
            I'm in the right relationship? <br>
            Aren't you really supposed to know that shit? <br>
            Feel it in your bones and own that shit? <br>
            I don't know <br>
            Then I had this interaction  <br>
            I've been thinking 'bout for like five weeks <br>
            Wonder if he's thinking 'bout it too and smiling <br>
            Wonder if he knows that that's been <br>
            what's inspiring me <br>
            Wonder if he's judging me like <br> 
            I am right now <br>
            I don't care <br>
            I'd rather tell the truth <br>
            Than make it worse for you <br>
            If the sun refused to shine <br>
            Baby, would I still be your lover? <br>
            Would you want me there? <br>
            If the moon went dark tonight <br>
            And if it all ended tomorrow <br>
            Would I be the one on your mind? <br>
            Your mind? Your mind? <br>
            And if it all ended tomorrow <br>
            Would you be the one on mine?</p>

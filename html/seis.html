            <p>I used to think that I wasn't fine enough <br>
            And I used to think that I wasn't wild enough <br>
            But I won't waste my time tryna figure out <br>
            why you playin' games <br>
            What's this all about? <br>
            And I can't believe <br>
            You're hurting me <br>
            I met your girl, what a difference <br>
            What you see in her <br>
            You ain't seen in me <br>
            But I guess it was all just make-believe <br>
            Oh, love <br>
            Never knew what I was missin' <br>
            But I knew once we start kissin' <br>
            I found <br>
            Love <br>
            Never knew what I was missin' <br>
            But I knew once we start kissin' <br>
            I found, found you <br>
            Now you're gone, what am I gonna do? <br>
            So empty <br>
            My heart, my soul, can't go on <br>
            Go on, without you <br>
            My rainy days fade away when you <br>
            Come around, please tell me, baby <br>
            Why you go so far away? <br>
            Why you go? <br>
            Love <br>
            Never knew what I was missin' <br>
            But I knew once we start kissin' <br>
            I found <br>
            Love <br>
            Never knew what I was missin' <br>
            But I knew once we start kissin' <br>
            I found, I found you <br>
            Who would have known I'd find you? <br>
            Ooh <br>
            Now you're gone, what am I gonna do? <br>
            So empty <br>
            My heart, my soul, can't go on <br>
            Go on, baby, without you <br>
            Rainy days fade away <br>
            When you come around <br>
            Say you're here to stay <br>
            With me, boy <br>
            I don't want you to leave me <br>
            I, I need you <br>
            Love <br>
            Never knew what I was missin' (I never knew) <br>
            But I knew once we start kissin' <br>
            I found (found love) <br>
            Love <br>
            Never knew what (I never) I was missin' (never, never) <br>
            But I knew once we start kissin' <br>
            I found (I found, I found) <br>
            Love <br>
            Never knew what I was missin' <br>
            But I knew once we start kissin' <br>
            I found.</p>

            <p>Oh, you got power, superpowers <br>
            Do you even know how to wield them? <br>
            All God's children are special <br>
            But not like you, no, not like you <br>
            You're just like a flower <br>
            (flower) <br>
            You're ever-giving, that's a given <br>
            All God's children are special <br>
            (all God's children, whoa) <br>
            But not like you, no, not like you <br>
            Lift your head to the sky <br> 
            (to the sky, oh sky, sky) <br>
            (Lift it, lift it, lift it, lift it) <br>
            It's crazy to say this <br>
            But you are the greatest <br>
            (you are the greatest) <br>
            Can't explain it (oh) <br>
            I know that you know, don't you? <br>
            They can't deny you, yeah <br>
            They can't deny you, it's true <br>
            Yeah, remember Vegas? <br> 
            You come a long way, kid <br>
            And let me just say this <br>
            Oh yeah, you're the main character now <br>
            You're the main character now <br>
            Lift your head to the sky <br> 
            (to the sky, oh sky, sky) <br>

            <p>Can we, we keep <br>
            Keep each other company? <br>
            Oh, maybe we can be <br>
            Be each other's company <br>
            Oh, company <br>
            Let's set each other's lonely nights <br>
            Be each other's paradise <br>
            Need a picture for my frame <br>
            Someone to share my reign <br>
            Tell me what you wanna drink <br>
            I tell you what I got in mind <br>
            Oh, I don't know your name <br>
            But I feel like that's gonna change <br>
            You ain't gotta be my lover <br>
            For you to call me baby <br>
            Never been around no pressure <br>
            Ain't that serious <br>
            Can we, we keep <br>
            Keep each other company? <br>
            Oh, maybe we can be <br>
            Be each other's company <br>
            Oh, company <br>
            Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh <br>
            It ain't about the complications <br>
            I'm all about the elevation <br>
            We can keep it going up <br>
            Oh, don't miss out on us <br>
            Just wanna have a conversation <br>
            Forget about the obligations <br>
            Maybe we can stay in touch <br>
            Oh, that ain't doing too much <br>
            You ain't gotta be my lover <br>
            For me to call you baby <br>
            Never been around no pressure <br>
            Ain't that serious, no <br>
            Can we, we keep <br>
            Keep each other company? <br>
            Oh, maybe we can be <br>
            Be each other's company <br>
            Oh, company <br>
            Can we be, can we be <br>
            Be each other's company? <br>
            Be each other's company? <br>
            Oh, just be each other's company <br>
            Oh, be each other's company <br>
            Can we, we keep <br>
            Keep each other company? <br>
